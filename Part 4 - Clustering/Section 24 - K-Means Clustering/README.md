**Observation:**
1. *Cluster 1* have high income and low spending score. So, in this cluster clients earn a high income but don't spend much money So, this cluster of clients can be called as *Careful*.
2. Clients in *Cluster 2* have average income and average spending score. Thus, it can be labeled as *Standard*.
3. Clients in *Cluster 3* have high income and high spending score. So, that is the cluster of clients that would be the main potential target of the mall marketing campaigns. It would be very insightful for them all to understand what kind of products are bought by the clients in this cluster. Hence, this cluster can be named as *Target*.
4. *Cluster 4* consists of clients who earn a low income but spend much. Therefore, can be called *Careless*.
5. As opposed to the clients who have low income but spends much, *Cluster 5* can be labeled as *Sensible*.
